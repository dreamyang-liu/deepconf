The total sum of the digits 1 through 9 is 45, and with three rows and three columns each summing to the same value, that value must be 15.\n\nThere are 8 distinct ways to arrange the digits to satisfy the row and column sum conditions. These arrangements are derived from the possible triplets that sum to 15: {1,5,9}, {1,6,8}, {2,4,9}, {2,5,8}, {2,6,7}, {3,4,8}, {3,5,7}, {4,5,6}. The grid must use each digit exactly once, and the row and column sums must be 15.\n\nThe arrangements are as follows:\n\n1.  \n5 9 1  \n8 6 1  \n4 7 3  \n\n2.  \n5 9 1  \n6 8 1  \n7 4 3  \n\n3.  \n9 5 1  \n4 6 5  \n2 7 6  \n\n4.  \n9 5 1  \n6 8 1  \n4 7 3  \n\n5.  \n2 7 6  \n9 5 1  \n4 8 1  \n\n6.  \n2 7 6  \n4 3 8  \n9 5 1  \n\n7.  \n3 5 7  \n4 6 5  \n8 2 1  \n\n8.  \n3 5 7  \n8 2 1  \n4 6 5  \n\nThese 8 arrangements are the only solutions that satisfy the conditions.",
